"We use Risk Up Front to get projects done on time. It works."

—R. MARTIN CHAVEZ, CFO, GOLDMAN SACHS
Risk Up Front (Book Cover)



Successful projects depend more on your team’s behavior than on their project tools.

This book focuses on the fundamentals: simple structures and practices, applied with rigor. These are the tools you need to avoid the late changes that kill project schedules. Underlying all of them are four principles: accountability, transparency, integrity and commitment. Risk Up Front is designed to turn these principles into practice.

Murphy’s Law tells us, “If anything can go wrong, it will.” With Risk Up Front, even risks hiding in your team’s blind spot can be discovered and handled, before Murphy has a chance.

“Risk Up Front fixed our Agile process and has become a company-wide discipline. Risk conversations now extend from the conference room﻿ to the board room.”
—MATT LITTLE, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, PKWARE, INC.

“We started by using Risk Up Front in global engineering and product development. Now we use it everywhere, from building clean rooms to upgrading our finance systems. In all cases, the results are faster execution, stronger teamwork, and better results. ”
—TIM JENKS, CEO, NEOPHOTONICS CORPORATION

CLIENTS
## GOLDMAN SACHS
"Brad Rubenstein and Adam Josephs introduced Celerity's project management framework to our group and it was proven to be extremely helpful in managing large scale project across multiple divisions."
## NEOPHOTONICS
"Celerity Consulting has been instrumental in moving NeoPhotonics from a research company to a product development and manufacturing enterprise. As a result of the tools that Celerity has introduced, we have seen a marked increase in both productivity and general morale as project teams measure their accomplishments and reduce their risk."
## LAM RESEARCH
"Celerity analyzes situations rapidly and precisely, and from that analysis, generates action plans that lead rapidly to results."
## NANOGRAM DEVICES CORP.
"In its early days, our company struggled with structure and product focus. Our CEO brought Celerity in to change that. Adam helped transform the culture from disparate and dysfunctional to one of accountability, focus, and dependability."
## SUNGARD
"Our consultant is a skillful mentor and tough coach. The two-day Celerity workshop that I attended was clearly the best training session I have ever been to."

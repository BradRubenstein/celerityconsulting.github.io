We are committed to transforming how teams execute projects. Our
approach focuses on the novel use of simple tools, engaging
participants in new types of conversations, and establishing the
rigorous application of core principles.  For novice teams, these
provide a starting point for getting organized.  For experienced
teams working on complex projects, we work with you to apply these
techniques to enhance and refine, not replace, existing best practices
and project planning tools your team is already using.

We work with teams in a broad range of industries, around the world,
to execute their projects faster and more reliably. Our clients
include semiconductor equipment manufacturers, financial technology
software companies, US congressional offices, market-leading ice
machine manufacturers, among many others.   Whether you are a small
startup with constrained funding and cutting-edge technology, or
you are a business unit within a multinational company whose teams
span continents and time zones, Risk Up Front has been used
successfully on projects like yours. What these projects have in
common is the need to create high-performance teams that are expert
at identifying and mitigating risks so the will deliver the right
result, reliably, on time.

Leveraging our Risk Up Front™  methodology, we coach project teams
to accelerate product development, management teams to meet their
quarterly objectives, and company-wide cross-functional teams to
implement organizational change.

## ACCELERATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

### Risk Up Front™ Product Development Framework

We are particular experts at coaching teams to ship products. The
Risk Up Front ™  framework is at the core of our methodology.  It
has been successfully applied to a wide variety of team projects,
from software development to political campaigns, though the “sweet
spot” for our framework originated in high risk product development.
Simple tools, rigorously applied, adds a critical dimension to your
projects, transforming how teams talk about risk and make commitments.
The end result is that the team will identify and mitigate risks
earlier, yielding faster and more successful projects.

## CREATE HIGH PERFORMANCE PROJECT TEAMS

### Risk Up Front™ Project Team Performance Tools

In our experience, cross-functional teams are the fundamental
mechanism for getting work done in organizations quickly and reliably.
Our clients regularly find themselves needing to form such teams
spontaneously, achieve high performance rapidly, deliver results
on time, then disband and redeploy individuals to form new teams
to address new opportunities and challenges.  The ability for an
organization to flexibly and rapidly deploy such high-performance
teams is a competitive advantage. We are experts at training and
coaching managers, team leaders, and team members on how to build
and maintain this core competency.

## JUMPSTART ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

### Risk Up Front™ Project Based Change

We believe organizational change is most reliably accomplished
through short, focused projects assigned to cross-functional teams,
that simultaneously deliver key business objectives and discrete
measurable increments of the desired organizational changes. In
organizations that appear to be “stuck”, we are experts at breaking
the inertia (along with the accompanying cynicism and resignation)
that stands in the way of progress.

# HOW WE WORK

![Working Together]({{ '/images/about2.png' | relative_url }})

Our engagements begin with a set of interviews across the organization,
which result in a brief report that is designed to be widely
circulated among the targeted team. We then train and coach this
pilot team, including management, that is focused on a commercially
critical project. We introduce a set of simple tools and a shift
in language that this pilot team adapts to the needs of the
organization. Existing practices that are inconsistent with the
values and goals of the company are revealed and addressed.

The initial, measurable goal of our work is that the milestones of
the pilot project are completed faster and with greater integrity.
We build upon the initial successes to spread best practices to
other projects and teach the organization to coach itself.

We are not looking simply to teach a course or drop off tools.  A
worthwhile engagement requires the commitment and active participation
by the entire cross-functional team, including senior management.
Our clients regularly see measurable and significant improvement
in their projects, organizations and profits because we are very
effective at helping companies change the way they execute.

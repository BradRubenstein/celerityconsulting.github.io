  <h1>Successful projects depend more on your team’s behavior than on their project tools.</h1>
  <p>This book focuses on the fundamentals: simple structures and practices, applied with rigor. These are the tools you need to avoid the late changes that kill project schedules. Underlying all of them are four principles: accountability, transparency, integrity and commitment. Risk Up Front is designed to turn these principles into practice.</p>
  <p>Murphy’s Law tells us, “If anything can go wrong, it will.” With Risk Up Front, even risks hiding in your team’s blind spot can be discovered and handled, before Murphy has a chance.</p>
